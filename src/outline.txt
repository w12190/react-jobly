  /*Todo List
x lift state from companyList to Routes
x setup state for JobList
x modify jobcard to Work
x implement jobcardlist

SUBROUTINE
1. CompanyList: a company is clicked, a state from Routes is set
  - clicked=CompanyCard?, so drill setter there?
2. CompanyDetails is loaded, state from Routes is passed along with 
  - sub-question what does CompanyDetails need to do its job? it needs
    - 1) company name
    - 2) company description
    - 3) all company jobs
3. Display JoCardList, passing it all the jobs
x. Afterwards, handle case where they just enter ./companies/handle (and it isn't set yet)

- implement JobList
- implement CompanyDetails
- implement search box and add to JobList & CompanyList
- Extra projects
  - combining useEffects() for different calls*/
  - combine companyList and companyToGetJobsFor states if no need after all routes implemented
- Minor Q's: is it bad practice to pass around extra key/value pairs in data POJO's (change depending on answer)
